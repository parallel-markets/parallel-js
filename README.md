# Parallel Markets JavaScript Modules

![CI Status](https://github.com/parallel-markets/parallel-js/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

This repo contains a few packages to make integration with the [Parallel Markets JavaScript SDK](https://developer.parallelmarkets.com/docs/javascript) as easy as possible.

If you'd just like to load our SDK via a `<script>` tag, then the starter example on [developer.parallelmarkets.com](https://developer.parallelmarkets.com/docs/javascript) is the easiest way to get started.

There is also a "vanilla" loader for the SDK that allows you to load it in an async way.  See the [@parallelmarkets/vanilla](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parallelmarkets/vanilla) package for more details.  There is a "webpack" example in the examples folder that loads the SDK using this method.

If you use [React](https://reactjs.org), there is a [@parallelmarkets/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parallelmarkets/react) library with components to display a button, determine status, and make API calls.  There is a "react-webpack" example in the examples folder that loads the SDK using this method.
